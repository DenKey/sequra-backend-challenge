      <h1><a href="https://sequra.github.io/backend-challenge/">seQura backend coding challenge</a></h1>
      

      <p>This coding challenge is for people who applied to the Senior Backend Developer position at seQura. The problem to solve is a simplified version of our daily problems.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>seQura provides e-commerce shops with a flexible payment method that allows shoppers to split their purchases in three months without any cost. In exchange, seQura earns a fee for each purchase.</p>

<p>When shoppers use this payment method, they pay directly to seQura. Then, seQura disburses the orders to merchants with different frequencies and pricing.</p>

<p>This challenge is about implementing the process of paying merchants.</p>

<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h2>

<p>We have to implement a system to automate the calculation of merchants’ disbursements payouts and seQura commissions for existing, present in the CSV files, and new orders.</p>

<p>The system must comply with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All orders must be disbursed precisely once.</li>
  <li>Each disbursement, the group of orders paid on the same date for a merchant, must have a unique alphanumerical <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reference</code>.</li>
  <li>Orders, amounts, and fees included in disbursements must be easily identifiable for reporting purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The disbursements calculation process must be completed, for all merchants, by 8:00 UTC daily, only including those merchants that fulfill the requirements to be disbursed on that day. Merchants can be disbursed daily or weekly. We will make weekly disbursements on the same weekday as their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">live_on</code> date (when the merchant started using seQura, present in the CSV files). Disbursements groups all the orders for a merchant in a given day or week.</p>

<p>For each order included in a disbursement, seQura will take a commission, which will be subtracted from the merchant order value gross of the current disbursement, following this pricing:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.00 %</code> fee for orders with an amount strictly smaller than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50 €</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.95 %</code> fee for orders with an amount between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50 €</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">300 €</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.85 %</code> fee for orders with an amount of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">300 €</code> or more.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Remember that we are dealing with money, so we should be careful with related operations. In this case, we should round up to two decimals following.</em></p>

<p>Lastly, on the first disbursement of each month, we have to ensure the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum_monthly_fee</code> for the previous month was reached. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum_monthly_fee</code> ensures that seQura earns at least a given amount for each merchant.</p>

<p>When a merchant generates less than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum_monthly_fee</code> of orders’ commissions in the previous month, we will charge the amount left, up to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum_monthly_fee</code> configured, as “monthly fee”. Nothing will be charged if the merchant generated more fees than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum_monthly_fee</code>.</p>

<p>Charging the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">minimum_monthly_fee</code> is out of the scope of this challenge. It is not subtracted from the disbursement commissions. Just calculate and store it for later usage.</p>
